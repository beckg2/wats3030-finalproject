# wats3030-finalproject
The final project in this course is a project to deploy a web application, with customizations and configured for your purposes, deployed to a custom domain. You will fulfill the following base requirements as you work through the assignments to build out your final project:

Determine a website concept you can customize and deploy using a pre-existing open source web application.
Install that application on a suitable server.
Customize the application by either installing a pre-existing theme, using provided tools to customize the look and feel, or modifying provided stylesheets and templates to create a personalized look for your project. (Please note: You are not expected to "build a theme" for this webapp unless you are pursuing a stretch goal. If, for example, you're using Wordpress for your site, you must install a theme of your choosing, and many themes will offer additional customization options to provide custom logos, choose different color palettes, etc. For the base requirement, you are expected to do something along those lines.)
Configure the application to use the best practices outlined for that specific application to provide a fast, secure application for users and staff alike.
Make your application available at a custom domain. (Please note: Your custom domain may be a subdomain of your personal domain, such as "mywebapp.yourname.com".)
If these requirements prove very easy for you to fulfill, then you are encouraged to pursue the following stretch requirements:

Increase the technical complexity of your project. (e.g. Rather than deploying a simple PHP/mySQL app, deploy a Python app or a set of Docker containers.)
Create a new theme for your webapp. (Build a theme for your chosen webapp starting with their theme starter kit, using whatever techniques and approaches they require.)
Combine apps in an innovative way. (e.g. Can you attach a great gallery system to your Wordpress install? Set up BuddyPress and integrate a service that tracks hikes?)
Build a custom frontend. (Some webapps make it easy to reveal a RESTful API that can be accessed from a custom frontend built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This means you can use, for example, the content management admin and database from Wordpress, but deliver content through a totally custom creative frontend you build using different fancy Javascript libraries.)
